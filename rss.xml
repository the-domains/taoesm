            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Teaching Students Philosophy Will Improve Their Academic Performance, Shows Study</h1><p>There are many attempts to improve student performance which result in a host of measures, ranging from misguided to inspired. Such efforts include not assigning students homework, recalibrating standardized tests to account for unfair background advantages, or subjecting students to the hard-to-fathom Common Core standards.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4fff28bad99e6a5275030182d1151d9ea646d762.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It is a much better indicator of your overall health.</h1><p>In a study published in the journal Molecular Cell, researchers discovered rapid aging in HIV patients. Biologist Trey Ideker and his team at the University of California, San Diego made this discovery, finding that these patients were susceptible to age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia five years earlier than their non-infected peers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0fa86e3042cf14b3007f7716102d78769ff19d7a.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is Machine Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)? | Numenta</h1><p>We are frequently asked how we distinguish our technology from others. This task is made difficult by the fact that there is not an agreed vocabulary; everybody uses the above terms (and other associated terms) differently. In addition, the commonly understood meaning of some of these terms has evolved over time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/919483cbc956622223e1363ce8c92b3fd03862af.png"></article>]]></description>
