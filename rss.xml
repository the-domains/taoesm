            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is Machine Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)? | Numenta</h1><p>We are frequently asked how we distinguish our technology from others. This task is made difficult by the fact that there is not an agreed vocabulary; everybody uses the above terms (and other associated terms) differently. In addition, the commonly understood meaning of some of these terms has evolved over time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/919483cbc956622223e1363ce8c92b3fd03862af.png"></article>]]></description>
