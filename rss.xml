            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Self-Assembling Granular Materials Are Changing the Future of Architecture</h1><p>Architects are toying with exotic new materials that can be poured into place and yet form complex structures Architecture is a conservative discipline, not least because of the exacting standards of stability and safety that all human-made structures must adhere to. The forces acting on and within any structure must be carefully calculated and the design modified accordingly.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4f90a48366048c8533c36cc0987ee2a5a8526f10.png"></article>]]></description>
