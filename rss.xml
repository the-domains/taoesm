            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is Machine Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)? | Numenta</h1><p>We are frequently asked how we distinguish our technology from others. This task is made difficult by the fact that there is not an agreed vocabulary; everybody uses the above terms (and other associated terms) differently.
