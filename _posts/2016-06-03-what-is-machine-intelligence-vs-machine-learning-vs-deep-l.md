  We are frequently asked how we distinguish our technology from others. This
  task is made difficult by the fact that there is not an agreed vocabulary;
  everybody uses the above terms (and other associated terms) differently. In
  addition, the commonly understood meaning of some of these terms has evolved
  over time.
