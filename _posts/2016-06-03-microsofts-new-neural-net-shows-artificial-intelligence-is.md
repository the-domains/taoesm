  Computer vision is now a part of everyday life. Facebook recognizes faces in
  the photos you post to the popular social network. The Google Photos app can
  find images buried in your collection, identifying everything from dogs to
  birthday parties to gravestones. Twitter can pinpoint pornographic images
  without help from human curators.
