  In a study published in the journal Molecular Cell, researchers discovered
  rapid aging in HIV patients. Biologist Trey Ideker and his team at the
  University of California, San Diego made this discovery, finding that these
  patients were susceptible to age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, heart
  disease, and dementia five years earlier than their non-infected peers.
